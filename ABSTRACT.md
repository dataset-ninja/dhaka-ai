The creators of the **Dhaka-AI: Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge Dataset** emphasize the distinctive traffic conditions in Dhaka city. Although it's a city of significant size, only 7% of its roads meet urban standards. However, it contends with a staggering 8 million daily commuters, all within a 306 square kilometer area. In response to this complex challenge, they introduced the AI-based Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge.

The primary objective of this challenge is to evaluate the effectiveness of advanced techniques in automated traffic detection using AI and ICT solutions, especially in the context of a diverse urban environment like Dhaka. Furthermore, the challenge seeks to encourage collaboration among experts in the region and establish a thriving AI-based community in South-East Asia.
