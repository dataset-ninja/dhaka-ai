The authors of **Dhaka-AI** dataset highlight the unique traffic situation in Dhaka, where only 7% of the roads meet urban standards for a city of its size, yet it experiences around 8 million daily commuters within a 306 sq km area. They propose a challenge for automated traffic detection using AI and ICT solutions to address this complex issue. The AI-Based Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge aims to assess the capabilities of cutting-edge methods in recognizing and detecting traffic vehicles in a diverse urban environment, fostering collaboration among experts in the region and building an AI-based community in South-East Asia.
